What is Demography?
<br><br>
Demography is the science of populations. Demographers seek to understand population dynamics by investigating three main demographic processes: birth, migration, and aging (including death). All three of these processes contribute to changes in populations, including how people inhabit the earth, form nations and societies, and develop culture. While most of the discipline's research focuses on humans, the MPIDR is also committed to the specialized field of biodemography.
<br>
Today, there is growing interest among the public in demography, as "demographic change" has become the subject of political debates in many developed countries. Most of these countries have birth rates below the replacement level of 2.1 children per woman, and, at the same time, life expectancy has been rising considerably and continues to rise - a development sometimes called "the aging of societies."
<br>
While demography cannot offer political advice on how to tackle demographic change, demographers seek to describe the phenomena related to this change, and to understand their causes. Using reliable data and the statistical processing of these data, modern demographic research embraces many scientific disciplines, including mathematics, economics and other social sciences, geography or biology.

Factors that Affect Human Population Growth
<br><br>
Human population is a topic that has been discussed in many forums pertaining to academic, social, economy, health...etc and is still a topic with enormous scope which attracts controversy and debate each time we take up the issue. According to world authorities in population statistics, the rate of growth in the human population represents a 'J' shape curve which indicates the probability of exponential growth of the population in the years to come. In fact, certain agencies are expecting the human population which stands at around 6.5 billion to cross the 10 billion mark by 2055 and some even predict this would arrive much sooner as millions of population is still unaccounted for in the most dense parts of the world such as China, India...etc.
<br>
The factors:
<br>
In population studies, it is imperative to identify the factors which govern the population growth in order to make remedial action to curb the explosion or else to manage resources to provide the population with necessary physical, social and mental well being. At the same time, these factors would vary from country to country and from region to region within the country as well. Thus, let us take a look at some of the broader factors which will influence the human population growth which is true to most parts of the world.
<br><br>
Economic situations
<br><br>
Although the economies of many parts of the world would encourage smaller families, it is evident from the developing world that, the size of the family although declined is still at a relatively higher number than in the developed world.
<br><br>
Cultural involvement
<br><br>
Culture does play an important role in the population growth as certain cultures promote increasing the number of family members exponentially whereas another may do the opposite. Such decisions would be dependent upon social norms and values which would be hard to change with implementation of regulations or policy decisions.
<br><br>
Improved mortality rates
<br><br>
With the advancement of health sciences, the mortality rates in relation to many aspects of life have reduced although it can be argued that, violence related deaths is seeing a steady increase in many parts of the world although its effect in the overall population is still not so significant.
<br><br>
Migration
<br><br>
Certain regions of the world derived its population through migration and this is still taking place due to various reasons. Thus, it is a factor which would influence, not the entire world population, but the population density of different parts of the world.
<br><br>
Agricultural developments
<br><br>
With the green revolution of 1970s, the increase in the population growth have yet to slow down and the sustained increase in agricultural developments would be vital to provide resources to these numbers and would have a reciprocal influence on the same as a maintaining factor of the human growth.
<br>
Apart from the factors mentioned above, there may be other factors which influence the population growth and with time, priority of these factors would also change with the rising demand, scarcity of resources as well as due to natural selection of the fittest.
<br><br>
What are the social implications of rapid population growth in less developed countries?
<br><br>
This is a complex issue. Rapid population growth in less developed countries is linked to many problems-including poverty, hunger, high infant mortality, and inadequacies in social services, health services, and infrastructure (transportation, communication, etc.). It would be a gross oversimplification to say that population growth causes these problems. Population growth could just as easily have been the effect of economic insecurity and poor health care. However, rapid population growth may defeat efforts to combat poverty and hunger and to improve services, as increasing numbers of people put serious pressures on the economy and society of poor nations.
<br>
Poverty, for example, existed long before the recent period of rapid population growth. An assessment of poverty must consider the amount and type of natural resources, including minerals and geographic features that a country possesses or lacks. It must also include an examination of the country's political and social structure. In areas where power and wealth are concentrated in the hands of a few, it is difficult for the poor to break out of the cycle of poverty that is often passed from generation to generation. Rapid population growth makes this effort even more difficult.
<br>
Hunger has always been a companion to poverty. Most experts agree that the world could feed today's population, and a considerably larger number, if income were redistributed, if modern farming methods were used everywhere, if land reform policies were put into effect, if meat consumption were reduced, if non-nutritious crops were replaced by nutritious crops, and if waste and corruption were controlled. However, rapid population growth may intensify the hunger problem; in the most rapidly growing countries, population growth can reduce or eliminate food production gains resulting from modernization of farming. Population pressures may also encourage practices such as overirrigation and overuse of croplands, which undermine the capacity to feed larger numbers.
<br>
In some cases, population growth is quite directly related to a social problem because it increases the absolute numbers whose needs must be met. For example, some less developed countries have made enormous progress in increasing the percentage of children enrolled in school. However, because of population growth during the same period, the number of children who are not enrolled in school also increased because there were insufficient resources to meet the growing need. Similar observations could be made about jobs, housing, sanitation, and other human needs. These problems are compounded when large numbers migrate from rural to urban areas and increase the burden placed on already inadequate supplies and services.

Nine Population Strategies to Stop Short of 9 Billion
<br><br>
Provide universal access to safe and effective contraceptive options for both sexes. With nearly two in five pregnancies reported as mistimed or never wanted, lack of access to good family planning services is among the biggest gaps in assuring that each baby will be wanted and welcomed in advance by its parents.
<br>
Guarantee education through secondary school for all, especially girls. In every culture surveyed to date, women who have completed at least some secondary school have fewer children on average, and have children later in life, than do women who have less education.
<br>
Eradicate gender bias from law, economic opportunity, health, and culture. Women who can own, inherit, and manage property; divorce; obtain credit; and participate in civic and political affairs on equal terms with men are more likely to postpone childbearing and to have fewer children compared to women who are deprived of these rights.
<br>
Offer age-appropriate sexuality education for all students. Data from the United States indicate that exposure to comprehensive programs that detail puberty, intercourse, options of abstinence and birth control, and respecting the sexual rights and decisions of individuals, can help prevent unwanted pregnancies and hence reduce birth rates.
<br>
End all policies that reward parents financially based on the number of children they have. Governments can preserve and even increase tax and other financial benefits aimed at helping parents by linking these not to the number of children they have, but to parenthood status itself.
<br>
Integrate lessons on population, environment, and development into school curricula at multiple levels. Refraining from advocacy or propaganda, schools should educate students to make well-informed choices about the impacts of their behavior, including childbearing, on the environment.
<br>
Put prices on environmental costs and impacts. In quantifying the cost of an additional family member by calculating taxes and increased food costs, couples may decide that the cost of having an additional child is too high, compared to the benefits of a smaller family that might receive government rebates and have a lower cost of living. Such decisions, freely made by women and couples, can decrease birth rates without any involvement by non-parents in reproduction.
<br>
Adjust to an aging population instead of boosting childbearing through government incentives and programs. Population aging must be met with the needed societal adjustments, such as increased labor participation, rather than by offering incentives to women to have more children.
<br>
Convince leaders to commit to stabilizing population growth through the exercise of human rights and human development. By educating themselves on rights-based population policies, policymakers can ethically and effectively address population-related challenges by empowering women to make their reproductive choices.

What Is Land Use?
<br><br>
If you've ever played a settlement building game like SimCity, you'll know all about land use. Land use is the function or functions that humans apply to the land available to them. The study of land use is the study of how the land is managed, including how the natural world is adapted to human needs.
<br>
Zoning is related to land use but is how governments regulate and control it. Zoning is what you do when you create a particular area in a SimCity game; you give permission for people to build houses, businesses or factories, but you don't build them yourself. Cities take control of this kind of thing to make their cities more pleasant to live in, to control pollution, protect the environment, and create efficient transport links.
<br><br>
Importance of Land Use
<br><br>
Land use might not seem like the most exciting topic, but it's important to study. First, it tells us a great deal about the governments making the decisions for land use and the priorities they hold. Also, the better we understand the way the world has been adapted to human needs, and in what patterns, the more we can predict future trends. And, the better we can predict the future of land use, the more we can prepare for negative impacts.
<br>
For example, if humans will continue to need huge amounts of wood and paper, it is likely that deforestation will continue. Since the human need for food isn't likely to ever go away, only a change in population or efficiency could cause agricultural land to decrease. Studying this topic allows us to better prepare for the future.
<br>
Land use is also related to the study of human trends and movements. The trend of urbanization, the idea that people who once lived in the country (or rural areas) are moving increasingly to cities (or urban areas), has a big impact on land use. Homes are becoming arranged in denser patterns, and our human population centers are changing shape all the time.
<br><br>
What is an Urban Planner?
<br><br>
Urban planning is the planning of land use in cities. Urban planning determines how to make the best use of available space. It involves creating land use plans as well as reviewing, approving, modifying, and sometimes rejecting the plans of developers.
<br>
Urban and city planners specialize in land use. They create plans and programs for the use of land and public facilities such as schools and libraries in their towns, cities, and counties.
<br><br>
Environmental impacts of farming
<br><br>
Farmed areas - both on land and in the water - provide important habitats for many wild plants and animals.
<br>
When farming operations are sustainably managed, they can help preserve and restore critical habitats, protect watersheds, and improve soil health and water quality.
<br>
But when practiced without care, farming presents the greatest threat to species and ecosystems. 
<br><br>
Multiple impacts
<br>
Negative environmental impacts from unsustainable farming practices include:
<br>
Land conversion & habitat loss<br>
Wasteful water consumption<br>
Soil erosion and degradation<br>
Pollution<br>
Climate change<br>
Genetic erosion<br>
<br>
PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF SOIL
<br><br>
SOIL TEXTURE
<br>
The particles that make up soil are categorized into three groups by size - sand, silt, and clay. Sand particles are the largest and clay particles the smallest. Most soils are a combination of the three. The relative percentages of sand, silt, and clay are what give soil its texture. A clay loam texture soil, for example, has nearly equal parts of sand, slit, and clay. These textural seperates result from the weathering process.
<br><br>
SOIL STRUCTURE
<br>
Soil structure is the arrangement of soil particles into small clumps, called peds or aggregates. Soil particles (sand, silt, clay and even organic matter) bind together to form peds. Depending on the composition and on the conditions in which the peds formed (getting wet and drying out, or freezing and thawing, foot traffic, farming, etc.), the ped has a specific shape. They could be granular (like gardening soil), blocky, columnar, platy, massive (like modeling clay) or single-grained (like beach sand). Structure correlates to the pore space in the soil which influences root growth and air and water movement.
<br><br>
SOIL COLOR
<br>
Soil color is influenced primarily by soil mineralogy - telling us what is in a specific soil. Soils high in iron are deep orange-brown to yellowish-brown. Those soils that are high in organic matter are dark brown or black. Color can also tell us how a soil "behaves" - a soil that drains well is brightly colored and one that is often wet and soggy will have a mottled pattern of grays, reds, and yellows.
<br><br>
What are the causes of solid waste pollution?
<br><br>
Trash collected from households often takes the form of plastic bags and organic waste. Solid feces flowing out of homes and into sewers pollute underground water. Commercial establishments also pile up a lot of such waste matter. Industrial units involved in manufacturing produce toxic solid waste, such as slag, from the industrial process of obtaining metals from their ores.
<br>
Hospitals and clinics also produce waste in the form of disposable syringes, used test tubes, plastic bags used for collecting blood, cotton swabs and used bandages. Such solid waste needs careful handling and disposal. The soil becomes polluted with dangerous medical waste when such matter is disposed of directly into landfills.
Solid waste is usually dumped in landfills. Landfills are large pits in the ground that act as garbage disposal places. The biodegradable matter in landfills becomes a part of the soil gradually. The toxic non-biodegradable and non-compostable matter poses a health hazard as it does not decompose but mixes with the soil and the underground water.
<br>
Industrial incinerators are used to burn trash on a large scale. They cause pollution by emitting greenhouse gases while burning solid waste.
<br><br>
Difference between Biodegradable and Non-Biodegradable Substances
<br><br>
Biodegradable substances
<br>
The term 'Biodegradable' is used for those things that can be easily decomposed by natural agents like water, oxygen, ultraviolet rays of the sun, acid rains, micro-organisms, etc. One can notice that when a dead leaf or a banana peel is thrown outside, it is acted upon by several micro-organisms like bacteria, fungi or small insects in a time period. The natural elements like oxygen, water, moisture and heat facilitate the decomposition thereby breaking the complex organic forms to simpler units. The decomposed matter eventually mixes or returns back to the soil and thus the soil is once again nourished with various nutrients and minerals.
<br><br>
Non-biodegradable substances
<br>
Those materials which cannot be broken down or decomposed into the soil by natural agents are labelled as non-biodegradable. These substances consists of plastic materials, metal scraps, aluminum cans and bottles, hazardous chemicals etc. These things are practically immune to the natural processes and thus cannot be fed upon or broken down even after thousands of years. Therefore, these waste rather than returning back, contribute to solid waste which is very hazardous for the environment. The ever increasing load of non-biodegradable trash is a growing concern all over the world and several countries are therefore, looking for eco-friendly alternatives that can minimize the threat on several land and aquatic life forms.
<br><br>
Solid waste volume reduction
<br>
Solid waste volume reduction can take place at several points in the waste management process. Solid waste volume reduction can take the form of precycling or reuse behavior on the part of consumers. This behavior reduces solid waste at the source and prevents materials from ever entering the waste stream . Precycling on the part of consumers is the best initial activity to reduce the volume of solid waste. Reuse is also a measure that prevents or delays the migration of materials to the landfill . Once the decision is made that a product is no longer useful and needs to be discarded, there are several management techniques that can be used.
<br>
Recycling diverts large volumes of materials from the waste stream to a manufacturing process. Glass, plastic, paper, cardboard, and other clean, source-separated materials are well-suited for use in the manufacture of new products. As markets become more readily available, the volume of materials that end up in landfills will be reduced even more.

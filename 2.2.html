Food Chains
<br><br>
The Sonoran Desert in the Southwestern United States may seem like a desolate place, but looks can be deceiving, because a wide array of wildlife can be found in this very dry environment. You might wonder how animals can make a living in the desert - after all, what is there for them to eat? Just like in every other ecosystem, all animals must eat other organisms, or, at the very least, secretions of other organisms, to acquire energy. We can follow a sequence of organisms that feed on each other to create a food chain, or a sequence of organisms that feed on each other.
<br>
Since a food chain follows the sequence of organisms that feed on each other, it always starts with an organism that gets its energy from an abiotic source, which is usually light from the sun. An organism that gets its energy from an abiotic source is called a producer. Since plants get their energy from sunlight, they are producers; one of the common producers in the Sonoran Desert is the prickly pear cactus. Many different animals eat the fruit of the prickly pear cactus, including Harris's antelope squirrel. The squirrel is a consumer because it gets its energy from other organisms. In this case, the squirrel gets its energy from the fruit of the prickly pear cactus.
<br>
In turn, the squirrel can be eaten by another consumer, the diamondback rattlesnake, and the rattlesnake can then be eaten by a roadrunner... and no, that is not a mistake. In the Sonoran Desert, roadrunners are deadly predators that will commonly pick up rattlesnakes by the tail and smash their head repeatedly onto the ground in a whip-like fashion. Once the rattlesnake is dead, the roadrunner will swallow it whole. In cases where the rattlesnake is too large to swallow all at once, the roadrunner will partially swallow the snake, with its tail still hanging out of its beak. As the first parts of the snake are digested, the roadrunner will then continue to swallow the rest of the snake.
<br>
The roadrunner itself can also be eaten by yet another predator: the Red-tailed hawk. You thought I was going to say a coyote, didn't you? Well, it turns out that, much like in the cartoon, adult roadrunners are just too fast for a coyote to catch, although coyotes will eat roadrunner eggs and chicks. In any case, the Red-tailed hawk is one of the few animals able to catch an adult roadrunner and make a meal of it, which puts the hawk at the top of our food chain.
<br><br>
Trophic Levels
<br><br>
So let's take a closer look at our food chain, which can be divided up into different trophic levels, or the levels of a food chain where organisms obtain their energy. The food chain starts with a producer, the prickly pear cactus, which obtains its energy from sunlight. The prickly pear is eaten by Harris's antelope squirrel, which, because it is the first consumer in the food chain, is called the primary consumer. The squirrel is eaten by the diamondback rattlesnake, which is called the secondary consumer. The rattlesnake is eaten by the roadrunner, which is the third consumer in the chain and therefore called the tertiary consumer. And finally, the fourth consumer in the chain, the Red-tailed hawk, is the quaternary consumer.
<br>
Now although this food chain is a possible sequence of events that could happen in the Sonoran Desert, each of the animals in the food chain is usually capable of eating other food items as well. Each of them could also be eaten by other animals in the desert, which means that there are a seemingly limitless number of other possible food chains. So, to more accurately describe energy flow through an ecosystem, ecologists can construct a food web, which is a combination of food chains that are interconnected to create a network of feeding relationships. Just like a food chain, energy enters the food web at the trophic level of the producers, which can also be called autotrophs. In the desert, autotrophs are often some type of cactus, grass, or shrub.
<br>
Plant-eating animals, or herbivores, such as grasshoppers, butterflies, jackrabbits, and desert tortoises, feed at the trophic level of the primary consumer. Carnivores, or animals that only eat other animals, like scorpions, snakes, spiders, hawks, owls, and mountain lions, can feed at the trophic levels of the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary consumer, or even higher if a particular food chain is long enough. And then there are some animals that eat both plants and animals, called omnivores. Omnivores, such as antelope squirrels, roadrunners, coyotes, and ringtails, can potentially feed at any of the consumer trophic levels.
<br>
There's just one more trophic level to talk about, and that's the level of the detritivore, which is an organism that feeds on waste products or dead organic material. Examples of detritivores include vultures, fungi, and bacteria. Since detritivores can take dead organic material and bring the stored energy back into the food web, they can be thought of as the recyclers of the ecosystem. After all, if there's energy just lying around, some organism will fill the niche and make use of this energy, and that's exactly what detritivores do.
<br><br>
Diversity-Stability Theory<br><br>
Theoretical models suggest that there could be multiple relationships between diversity and stability, depending on how we define stability (reviewed by Ives & Carpenter 2007). Stability can be defined at the ecosystem level - for example, a rancher might be interested in the ability of a grassland ecosystem to maintain primary production for cattle forage across several years that may vary in their average temperature and precipitation. Figure 1 shows how having multiple species present in a plant community can stabilize ecosystem processes if species vary in their responses to environmental fluctuations such that an increased abundance of one species can compensate for the decreased abundance of another. Biologically diverse communities are also more likely to contain species that confer resilience to that ecosystem because as a community accumulates species, there is a higher chance of any one of them having traits that enable them to adapt to a changing environment. Such species could buffer the system against the loss of other species. Scientists have proposed the insurance hypothesis to explain this phenomenon (Yachi & Loreau 1999). In this situation, species identity - and particular species traits - are the driving force stabilizing the system rather than species richness per se.
<br>
In contrast, if stability is defined at the species level, then more diverse assemblages can actually have lower species-level stability. This is because there is a limit to the number of individuals that can be packed into a particular community, such that as the number of species in the community goes up, the average population sizes of the species in the community goes down. For example, in Figure 2, each of the simple communities can only contain three individuals, so as the number of species in the community goes up, the probability of having a large number of individuals of any given species goes down. The smaller the population size of a particular species, the more likely it is to go extinct locally, due to random - stochastic - fluctuations, so at higher species richness levels there should be a greater risk of local extinctions. Thus, if stability is defined in terms of maintaining specific populations or species in a community, then increasing diversity in randomly assembled communities should confer a greater chance of destabilizing the system.
<br><br>
Experiments and Observations Can Evaluate the Diversity-Stability Relationship<br><br>
A wealth of research into the relationships among diversity, stability, and ecosystem functioning has been conducted in recent years (reviewed by Balvanera et al. 2006, Hooper et al. 2005). The first experiments to measure the relationship between diversity and stability manipulated diversity in aquatic microcosms - miniature experimental ecosystems - containing four or more trophic levels, including primary producers, primary and secondary consumers, and decomposers (McGrady-Steed et al. 1997, Naeem & Li 1997). These experiments found that species diversity conferred spatial and temporal stability on several ecosystem functions. Stability was conferred by species richness, both within and among functional groups (Wardle et al. 2000). When there is more than one species with a similar ecological role in a system, they are sometimes considered "functionally redundant." But these experiments show that having functionally redundant species may play an important role in ensuring ecosystem stability when individual species are lost due to environmental changes, such as climate change.
<br>
More recently, scientists have examined the importance of plant diversity for ecosystem stability in terrestrial ecosystems, especially grasslands where the dominant vegetation lies low to the ground and is easy to manipulate experimentally. In 1995, David Tilman and colleagues established 168 experimental plots in the Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve, each 9 x 9 m in size (Figure 3A), and seeded them with 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16 species drawn randomly from a pool of 18 possible perennial plant species (Tilman et al. 2006). Plots were weeded to prevent new species invasion and ecosystem stability was measured as the stability of primary production over time. Over the ten years that data were collected, there was significant interannual variation in climate, and the researchers found that more diverse plots had more stable production over time (Figure 3B). In contrast, population stability declined in more diverse plots (Figure 3C). These experimental findings are consistent with the theory described in the prior section, predicting that increasing species diversity would be positively correlated with increasing stability at the ecosystem-level and negatively correlated with species-level stability due to declining population sizes of individual species.
<br>
Experiments manipulating diversity have been criticized because of their small spatial and short time scales, so what happens in naturally assembled communities at larger spatial scales over longer time scales? In a 24-year study of naturally assembled Inner Mongolia grassland vegetation, Bai et al. (2004) observed variation in the biomass of species, functional groups, and the whole community in response to strong interannual variation in growing-season precipitation. They found that while the abundance of individual species fluctuated, species within particular functional groups tended to respond differently such that a decrease in the abundance of one species was compensated for by an increase in the abundance of another. This compensation stabilized the biomass productivity of the whole community in a fluctuating environment. These findings demonstrate that local species richness - both within and among functional groups - confers stability on ecosystem processes in naturally assembled communities.
<br>
Experiments in aquatic ecosystems have also shown that large-scale processes play a significant role in stabilizing ecosystems. A whole-lake acidification experiment in Canada found that although species diversity declined as a result of acidification, species composition changed significantly and ecosystem function was maintained (Schindler 1990). This suggests that given sufficient time and appropriate dispersal mechanisms, new species can colonize communities from the regional species pool and compensate for those species that are locally lost (Fischer et al. 2001). This observation emphasizes the importance of maintaining connectivity among natural habitats as they experience environmental changes.
<br><br>
Trophic Levels<br><br>
The feeding positions in a food chain or web are called trophic levels. The different trophic levels are defined in the Table below. Examples are also given in the table. All food chains and webs have at least two or three trophic levels. Generally, there are a maximum of four trophic levels.
<br>
Many consumers feed at more than one trophic level. Humans, for example, are primary consumers when they eat plants such as vegetables. They are secondary consumers when they eat cows. They are tertiary consumers when they eat salmon.
<br><br>
Trophic Levels and Energy<br><br>
Energy is passed up a food chain or web from lower to higher trophic levels. However, generally only about 10 percent of the energy at one level is available to the next level. This is represented by the ecological pyramid in Figure below. What happens to the other 90 percent of energy? It is used for metabolic processes or given off to the environment as heat. This loss of energy explains why there are rarely more than four trophic levels in a food chain or web. Sometimes there may be a fifth trophic level, but usually there's not enough energy left to support any additional levels.
<br><br>
Trophic Levels and Biomass<br><br>
With less energy at higher trophic levels, there are usually fewer organisms as well. Organisms tend to be larger in size at higher trophic levels, but their smaller numbers result in less biomass. Biomass is the total mass of organisms at a trophic level. The decrease in biomass from lower to higher levels.

What is BIOMASS?  
<br><br>
Biomass is biological material derived from living, or recently living organisms. In the context of biomass for energy this is often used to mean plant based material, but biomass can equally apply to both animal and vegetable derived material.

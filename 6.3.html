Environmental Science Careers
<br><br>
Careers in Environmental Science are so varied it is difficult to consider them as one category. You could end up working from home most of the time or traveling around the world on an annual basis. You could be doing desk work, field work, or some combination thereof. Your focus could be mathematical, physical, or written. Of course the majority careers in Environmental Science are some blend in-between.
<br>
Those engaged in Environmental Policy, Planning, and Management usually work for a local government and are likely to be engaged in a lot of research intensive work. Environmental Lawyers may be able to get out of the office to the courtroom, or, again, have intensive desk jobs. Wildlife Managers, Zoologists, and Horticulturists are often thought to have positions which keep them working in a mix of indoors and out, but generally in one location. Oceanographers and Meteorologists could spend their entire careers in the safety of a laboratory working upper level computer models, or much of their time at sea, studying the weather. Microbiologists, Soil and Plant Scientists, and Ecologists could work in remediation efforts, for sanitation companies, in manufacturing, at a university, for many private companies, law firms, not-for-profit groups, or government agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Park Service, or the United States Geological Survey.
<br>
Knowing what is available to you professionally is half the battle when choosing a career. Finding something you enjoy doing within the broad scope of Environmental Science shouldn't be terribly difficult when there are so many options. Environmental Consultants may have the best of many worlds, setting their own schedules, seeking clients that need their particular form of expertise, and setting their own blend of ideal field work and intellectual work schedule. Find what you enjoy doing, and it shouldn't be "work", but a career.
<br>
Environmental scientists are problem solvers. They research environmental and health problems to determine their causes and come up with solutions. They investigate issues like mysterious deformations in frogs, unexplained cancer occurrences in a neighborhood, or disease in the former asbestos mining town of Libby, Montana.
<br>
Environmental scientists conduct research to identify the causes of these types of problems, and how to minimize or eliminate them. They also conduct theoretical research that increases our understanding of how the natural world works. They use what they learn to make recommendations and develop strategies for managing environmental problems.
<br>
Environmental science is a holistic and multidisciplinary field that integrates the biological, physical, and earth sciences. Its goal is to understand how earth works and how it supports life. It also aims to identify, control, and prevent disruption to its systems and species caused by human activity.
<br>
Environmental scientists use their knowledge of earth's systems to protect the environment and human health. They do this by cleaning up contaminated areas, making policy recommendations, or working with industry to reduce pollution and waste. They may also investigate the source of an environmental or health problem, and devise strategies to combat it.

<br>
What Does an Environmental Scientist Do?
<br>
Environmental scientists conduct research to identify, control, or eliminate sources of pollutants or hazards affecting the environment or public health. Their research generally involves determining data collection methods; collecting and analyzing air, water, and soil samples; analyzing environmental data gathered by others; and analyzing for correlations to human activity. They also need to prepare reports and presentations that explain their findings.
<br>
Environmental scientists also develop plans to prevent, control, or fix environmental problems like air pollution. They may also advise government officials that make policy, and businesses that need to follow regulations or improve their practices. Some conduct environmental inspections of businesses. Many assess the potential effects of development projects to prevent creating new problems.
<br>
Some environmental scientists and specialists focus on environmental issues, while others focus on issues relating to human health. Either way, they work on critical issues, solving some of the most important problems of our day.

Environmental Science Jobs & Job Description
<br>
Environmental scientists work in applied fields and interdisciplinary settings analyzing the effects that humans have on our environment and the plants and animals that populate it. From agriculture to healthcare to industry, environmental scientists teach, research, and work in business to help humans understand our work. While tasks do vary significantly from job to job, the scope of an environmental scientist job is listed below:<br><br>
Develop research methods and systems that are best fit for the chemicals and environment that are being researched<br>
Use observations, samples, and specimens to collect data<br>
Review current scientific literature on an ongoing basis to stay abreast of developments in the field<br>
Record and store observations, samples and specimens in the lab and in fieldwork<br>
Develop systems to better analyze data<br>
Present research findings to internal and external stakeholders through a variety of media channels<br>
Communicate with senior scientists and administrators through formal and informal reports<br><br>
A senior environmental scientist or chief researcher may have the following or similar additional responsibilities, depending on the goals of the project. These additional tasks tend to be focused on project management and budgetary management:<br><br>

Create project timelines and budgetary metrics<br>
Ensure quality, integrity, project organization<br>
Track field and lab data<br>
Manage communications from the work group to stakeholders, senior administrators and the public<br>
Supervise field and lab work and overlapping project segments and workgroups<br>
Train and supervise administrative support staff<br>
Construct grant applications to be awarded funding<br>

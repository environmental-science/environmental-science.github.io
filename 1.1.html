What Is Environmental Science?
<br>
What do you think would happen if all of the trees in the rainforest were cut down, or if chemicals were spilled in a river, or if snow and rain fall increased 
drastically?
<br>
These are some of the many topics that are studied in the field of environmental science. Overall, environmental science is the field of science that studies the 
interactions of the physical, chemical, and biological components of the environment and also the relationships and effects of these components with the organisms in 
the environment. The field of environmental science can be divided into three main goals, which are to learn how the natural world works, to understand how we as 
humans interact with the environment, and also to determine how we affect the environment. The third goal of determining how humans affect the environment also 
includes finding ways to deal with these effects on the environment.
<br><br>
Interdisciplinary Field
<br>
Environmental science is also referred to as an interdisciplinary field because it incorporates information and ideas from multiple disciplines. Within the natural 
sciences, such fields as biology, chemistry, and geology are included in environmental science. When most people think of environmental science, they think of these 
natural science aspects, but what makes environmental science such a complex and broad field is that it also includes fields from the social sciences and the 
humanities.
<br>
The social science fields that are incorporated into environmental science include geography, economics, and political science. Philosophy and ethics are the two 
fields within the humanities that are also included in environmental science. By combining aspects of the natural sciences, social sciences, and the humanities, the 
field of environmental science can cover more concepts and also examine problems and topics from many different points of view.

10 of Today's Most Important Environmental Issues
<br>
While this guide to important environmental issues is not comprehensive, if you're new to green or simply want a refresher overview, this list neatly summarizes some 
of our most pressing environmental concerns... some of which cannot be solved simply via creative upcycling or small-space living.
<br>
1. Climate Change
<br>
Global warming has been concerning scientists for decades, but Al Gore legitimized the crisis with his controversial film An Inconvenient Truth. From the melting 
polar ice caps to catastrophic weather and threatened ecosystems, not only is climate change real, scientists agree that humans are influencing climate change with 
our production of greenhouse gases (mainly stemming from carbon dioxide and methane). What can you do? How bad is it? Why do so many people still think climate change 
isn't real? Is it real? These are just some of the issues worth exploring. The good news is that despite the urgency of the crisis, there are exciting technological 
developments as well as meaningful lifestyle changes you can make to help.
<br>
2. Energy
<br>
Clean energy vs. dirty energy. Renewable energy. Energy independence. Petroleum. Biofuels. Coal. ANWR and offshore drilling. Even Paris Hilton has something to say 
about energy. Energy is second only to climate change in significance, but the picture isn't as clear as one might think. China is heavily criticized, but did you 
know the state of California is worse? Look for plenty of myth-busting and interesting news to come, as well as practical tips to reduce your own energy dependence. 
Though no single energy source is going to be the solution, positive developments toward a cleaner future are happening every single day.
<br>
3. Waste
<br>
With the immediate looming problems of climate change and energy, focus has shifted away from landfill waste, but this is a serious problem. The world has largely 
gotten accustomed to a throwaway lifestyle, but that's neither healthy nor sustainable. Waterways are choked with trash and modernized nations ship their undesirable 
leftovers to the developing world. Fashion fashion, fast food, packaging and cheap electronics are just some of the problems. The amount of waste the industrialized 
world generates is shocking. Water bottles are the defining symbol of this critical issue. Fortunately, people are becoming aware of the consequences of "fast 
consumption" and there are many simple changes you can make in your own life to help significantly reduce landfill waste.
<br>
4. Water
<br>
Pure Water is in short supply. Our global reserves of drinkable water are a fraction of 1% and 1 in 5 humans does not have access to potable (safe) water. Many people 
do not realize that strife has already broken out in some stressed regions. There are many potential solutions, some promising, others challenging. Desalinization is 
an energy-inefficient, expensive option. But there are many things you can do. (Hint: it starts with turning off the faucet when you brush.)
<br>
5. Food
<br>
Biofuels have turned into a global controversy - the idea that people may causing the starvation of millions in order to fuel their SUVs is sickening. And yet that's 
not the whole picture. For example, eating hamburgers has as much or more impact on the global food picture as the use of biofuels. And then there's the whole issue 
of 'food miles' - at first, local seemed logical, but the situation is more complex than that. It's all about resources and efficiency. There are big questions: can 
we support the world without turning to vegetarianism? We know that the planet can't afford the Western way of eating. It would take 5 earths to support that 
lifestyle! What about hunting - is that good for the environment? Look for more articles soon exploring the complicated world of food. Fortunately, there are a 
multitude of tasty diets that incorporate greener values, so it's not necessary to adhere to veganism, for example.
<br>
6. Consumption
<br>
This is directly tied to waste. It is well-known that the industrialized world simply consumes in a way that is not sustainable. And the developing world is rapidly 
imitating the model. Sustainability in the most compelling sense is about long-term solvency. The way we live now is borrowing against the future. Reducing 
consumption, and smart consumption, are both necessary - and there are many ways to go about doing this. Some methods are pure geek, some are high tech, and some are 
just common sense. And once you start exploring, you'll see that it's actually fun.
<br>
7. Land Management
<br>
From desertification to polar ice melting to erosion and deforestation, existing land management choices are not serving the planet or its inhabitants very well. The 
1990s saw some headway with forest management but the Bush administration's various initiatives (most notoriously, 'Healthy Forests') have set back progress by 
decades. There is very little land left that is undeveloped, either with structures or roads. And there is virtually no land left that is not subject to light or 
noise pollution. The modern green movement believes that in order to create a sustainable future, people will need to return to the conservation spirit Americans were 
once famous for. That's a value system that includes meaning, adventure, and self-sufficiency - no wonder so many people are getting inspired.
<br>
8. Ecosystems and Endangered Species
<br>
The good news is that some species have made a comeback. The bad news is that many more species are now under threat, including indicator species and evolutionarily 
unique species. (When an indicator species becomes threatened, endangered, or worse, extinct, this means an entire ecosystem faces collapse.) The consequences can 
have global impact. From the most unusual endangered animals to a complete list of indicator species for key ecosystems and how you can help, you'll find plenty of 
fascinating information soon. (Be sure to bookmark this post and check back for updates and links.)
<br>
9. The Science of Public Health Issues
<br>
Our tomatoes have fish DNA? Killer bugs are on the loose? Superweeds are taking over corn fields? Wild animals are sprouting extra limbs? Autism is on the rise? WTF! 
What on earth (literally) is going on? From genetic manipulation and cloning to public health issues and food and drug contamination, get to know the new, strange, 
important and most interesting green issues related to genetic science, agribusiness, public health and more. What's this about electromagnetic fields? Is all that 
exhaust on my commute killing me? Do cell phones really cause cancer? Will soy milk give me man boobs? How much of our groundwater is contaminated? Is smog getting 
worse or better? How much acid rain is there? Why can't I drink out of streams? These are just some of the fascinating questions you can read about here in future 
posts. You can look forward to sane analysis that debunks myth and takes fear-mongering to task. Did you guess the tenth issue? There are more issues, but those are 
the most critical green challenges. It will take a combination of technological developments and lifestyle changes to address these challenges successfully - and that 
begins with learning, which is perhaps the most important environmental challenge of all, rounding out the list at 10.
<br><br>
Valuing the Environment for Decisionmaking
<br>
In dealing with complex environmental issues, determining the value of multiple environmental attributes is problematic, but not doing so is even more so.
<br>
Making thoughtful decisions about environmental challenges that involve wide-ranging and potentially irreversible consequences is of profound importance for current 
and future human wellbeing. How much and how fast should greenhouse gas emissions be reduced to minimize global climate change? What standards should be set for air 
and water quality? What should be done to protect biodiversity and to maintain ecological processes? Addressing such questions involves weighing benefits and costs in 
multiple dimensions. In spite of the high stakes, however, the nation-its government and society-often fails to take systematic account of the environmental 
consequences in its actual decisionmaking and instead follows standard operating procedures or existing legislative mandates, or simply muddles through.
<br>
Virtually all important environmental management and policy decisions have a wide range of effects. For example, zoning or development decisions about land use can 
have a variety of environmental impacts (for example, on local water and air quality, the potential for flooding downstream, carbon sequestration, and habitat for 
wildlife) as well as economic and social effects (on economic development, jobs, and income). Similarly, decisions on limits on emissions of air pollutants or 
greenhouse gases can affect a range of environmental, economic, and social concerns. These results affect multiple groups who often have very different views about 
desired outcomes (for example, developers versus environmentalists). Effects differ across geography (upstream versus downstream) and time (current versus future 
impacts). Choosing among management or policy options that differ in terms of environmental, economic, and social outcomes with spatial and temporal components may at 
first glance seem overwhelmingly complex, with dimensions that seem incomparable. Good environmental management and policy decisionmaking, however, necessitates 
systematic evaluation and consideration of the effects of management and policy on the affected public. Even though the quantitative valuation of these effects will 
never be perfect, the outcome of attempts to assess value provides important information to help guide decisionmaking.
<br><br>
Decisions, decisions
<br>
Management and policy decisions typically involve difficult tradeoffs that bring improvements in some dimensions and declines in others. Ultimately, deciding whether 
to choose management or policy alternative A or B requires an evaluation of whether A or B is 'better,' where better is determined by the objectives of the 
decisionmaker. It is easy to conclude that one alternative is better than another if it is better in all dimensions. But making comparisons in which one alternative 
is better in some dimensions but worse in others requires making difficult value judgments. For example, clearing land for housing development may result in higher 
incomes and more jobs but reduce habitat for species and worsen local water quality. Whether land clearing is the right decision will depend on whether an increase in 
incomes and jobs is valued more highly than maintaining habitat and water quality. But how can one really compare income versus habitat for species or jobs versus 
water quality? Comparing across these different dimensions seems like comparing the proverbial apples and oranges. Reaching an environmental management or policy 
decision, though, requires the decisionmaker to compare apples and oranges, either explicitly or implicitly.
<br>
For an individual, deciding which college to attend, where to live, or what job to take is often a hard choice to make, in large part because it involves changes in 
multiple dimensions simultaneously. Moving to a new job in a new city may be a better professional opportunity and offer a new set of cultural amenities, but is it 
worth disrupting family life, moving away from friends, and making adjustments to a new community? Though it is difficult to compare such alternatives, people do make 
these decisions all the time. In choosing an option, taking account of all the factors, people make a determination that one option is better than the other available 
options.
<br>
As difficult as such choices can be for an individual, making environmental management and policy decisions adds yet another level of complexity. Such decisions 
affect many people simultaneously and thus require finding a way to aggregate values across different people to reach a decision. Management and policy decisions can 
make some groups better off while making others worse off, requiring a different sort of apples-and-oranges comparison.
<br>
Two methods used in such multidimensional, multiperson decisionmaking contexts are economic benefit/cost calculations and multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA). Each 
of these methods transforms a complex multidimensional problem involving multiple people into a single dimension that can be used to rank alternatives. These methods 
act like a blender that mixes apples and oranges to produce a fruit smoothie. Decisionmakers can then decide which fruit smoothie they like the best.
<br>
Economics reduces multidimensional problems to a single dimension by measuring the value of changes in each dimension with a common metric, which is typically, but 
not necessarily, a monetary metric. Economists tend to prefer a monetary metric because it is a pervasive, intuitive, and easily observable measure of the values that 
people attribute to an array of everyday goods and services. In wellfunctioning markets, the price of a good or service reflects its marginal value to the buyer 
measured in terms of the common monetary metric: what the buyer is willing to pay to have the good or service. This fact makes the marginal values of many very 
different goods and services commensurable. The concept extends even to environmental attributes that do not have a market value, such as clean air, as long as people 
are willing to make tradeoffs in their consumption of some market goods in order to obtain other nonmarket attributes.
<br>
The ability to measure values with a common monetary metric rests on two key premises. First, individual willingness to pay for an item is assumed to accurately 
represent the value of that item to the individual: that is, how much better off the individual is with the item than without the item, measured in monetary terms. 
Second, the aggregation of values to the societal level requires that the correspondence between willingness to pay and well-being be comparable across individuals, 
so that a measure of societal value is equal to the (appropriately weighted) sum of values across all individuals in society. This comparability is necessary in order 
to do benefit/cost analysis resulting in a single number that summarizes social net benefits.
<br>
With the ability to produce an aggregate social net benefit calculation for any policy option, the economic benefit/cost decision rule is simple: Choose the option 
that maximizes social net benefits. This simple rule can be extended to account for uncertainty by maximizing expected social net benefits, where net benefits for 
individuals can include risk aversion (that is, a willingness to pay to avoid being subjected to uncertain outcomes). The decision rule can also incorporate 
constraints that restrict outcomes, so that they do not violate minimum environmental standards or basic human rights. As noted, however, the social net benefit 
calculation requires that individuals evaluate multiple dimensions with a single monetary metric of value and that these values be comparable across individuals. 
Without such interpersonal comparability, management or policy changes resulting in both winners and losers cannot be evaluated. In this case, only alternatives in 
which everyone is better off are clearly superior, and such alternatives are extremely unlikely to emerge.
<br>
Benefit/cost calculations have been applied to a wide variety of environmental policies. All recent presidents, both Democratic and Republican, have required agencies 
to evaluate the benefits and costs of regulations, including environmental regulations. Executive Order 12866 signed by President Clinton in 1993 states that agencies 
'shall assess both the costs and the benefits of the intended regulation' and 'in choosing among alternative regulatory approaches, agencies should select those 
approaches that maximize net benefits' The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has done extensive benefit/cost calculations of regulations, particularly regulations 
under the Clean Air Act. The EPA estimated that the 1990 Clean Air Act would provide benefits of $2 trillion between 1990 and 2020 while imposing costs of $65 
billion, a benefit-to-cost ratio of approximately 30-to-1. A prior study of the benefits and costs of the Clean Air Act from 1970 to 1990 found a similarly large 
benefitto-cost ratio.
<br>
The economic benefit/cost approach to maximizing social net benefits may be thought of as belonging to the broader class of MCDA methods, all of which require 
explicit or implicit weighting of various attributes of expected outcomes of management or policy decisions. Although some MCDA methods accommodate only quantitative 
attributes, others also permit qualitative attributes. Given attributes and weights, different MCDA methods take different approaches to evaluating alternatives. Some 
methods seek to identify the best alternative, similar to the economic approach of maximizing social net benefits, while others, such as goal programming, seek to 
identify alternatives that meet certain thresholds of performance. In goal programming, aspirational or minimally acceptable thresholds are set for each criterion, 
and alternatives are evaluated according to the priority-weighted distances by which criteria fall short of these thresholds. In general, MCDA methods seek to 
maximize a social welfare function of a particular, often implicit, form.
<br><br>
Setting relative values
<br>
To be operational, benefit/cost and MCDA methods require information on relative values (weights) for different dimensions of value affected by environmental 
management or policy. Economics and decision sciences tend to take different approaches to assembling information about values. In economics, the values of different 
management or policy options are derived from aggregating the net benefits to individuals in society for that option. In decision sciences, a variety of methods are 
used to assemble information on weights to assign to different dimensions.
<br>
The task of the economist in understanding relative values for an individual is far easier for marketed goods and services than for nonmarketed environmental 
attributes. For marketed goods and services, economists use observations on how much is purchased at a given price over a range of different prices to construct a 
demand function. The demand function summarizes information on the willingness to pay of the individual for the good or service. In competitive markets, the supply 
function reflects the marginal cost of producing the good or service. Demand and supply can be used to define economic surplus, which is the difference between the 
(marginal) willingness to pay given by demand and the marginal cost of production given by supply. Summing up this difference over the entire quantity traded is equal 
to economic surplus; that is, the value generated from the production and consumption of the good or service.
<br>
Some environmental changes directly affect marketed goods and services, and the value of these effects can be evaluated by assessing the net change in economic 
surplus in the affected markets. Take, for example, the potential effects of excess nutrients in a body of water that cause dead zones (areas of low oxygen), 
resulting in lowered fish and shellfish populations and reduced commercial harvests. With basic information about consumer demand and the costs of supply, economists 
can estimate the expected loss in economic surplus from the reduction in harvests. Adjustments to economic surplus calculations are necessary when market 
imperfections, such as monopoly pricing, taxes, or subsidies, result in price distortions so that prices are not a true reflection of the value of marketed goods and 
services.
<br>
The concept of economic surplus (value) also applies to environmental attributes, such as clean air or access to natural areas, for which there is no market. Valuing 
nonmarket goods and services is more difficult, because there is no readily observable signal of value that is comparable to a market price. Economists have devised a 
suite of nonmarket valuation tools that can be applied to value nonmarketed environmental attributes. Some nonmarket valuation methods use observable expenditure on a 
different marketed good or service to draw an inference about the value of the nonmarketed environmental attribute of interest. For example, housing prices may 
reflect the increased willingness to pay for housing in locations with better environmental amenities, such as access to lakes and parks or better air quality. The 
choice of where to recreate can reveal information about the relative value of environmental amenities that vary across recreation sites. Other methods of estimating 
value record changes in expenditures, such as changes in the cost to treat drinking water with changes in water quality.
<br>
Economists cannot use observed expenditures to value all important changes to the environment. For example, if all of the lakes in a region are polluted and no one 
uses them for recreation, it will be difficult to assess the value of reducing pollution on recreational value, unless one is willing to make inferences from other 
regions. More fundamentally, there are limited or no directly observable expenditures or other behavioral clues for some environment attributes, particularly non-use 
benefits such as knowing that species exist. In Antonio Briceño, Overfishing, from the Millions of Pieces: Only One Puzzle Project, Digital c-print on Fuji Crystal 
Archival paper, 21 x 60 inches, 2010. the absence of observable behavior, economists use survey questions to ask people about values for changes in environmental 
attributes. Such 'stated preference' methods include contingent valuation and conjoint analysis. The contingent valuation method presents survey respondents with a 
hypothetical change in the environment, such as a 10% increase in the size of humpback whale populations, and asks whether they would be willing to pay a specified 
amount for the change. Varying the specified amount and observing the proportion of people saying yes generates information analogous to a demand curve for marketed 
goods and services. In conjoint analysis, people are asked to rank a series of outcomes that differ in the quantities of various attributes. Conjoint analysis allows 
direct evaluation of how people trade off one attribute versus another, such as an improvement in air quality versus greater access to open space. If one of the 
attributes is income or expenditure, then the analyst can also estimate willingness to pay.
<br>
Some actions, such as emissions of greenhouse gases, cause changes in multiple dimensions that occur over extended periods. For example, a change in carbon storage in 
ecosystems that reduces atmospheric concentrations causes changes in climate forcing and ocean acidification, which in turn affect myriad other environmental 
attributes, including precipitation patterns, with effects on agricultural production, the probability and severity of flooding, and the health of marine resources, 
among others. Summarizing the value of all these changes into a single estimate of the social cost of carbon (SCC) requires complex integrated assessment models that 
predict both environmental and economic outcomes and attach estimates of the value of those outcomes. Further complicating matters, SCC estimates depend on levels of 
emissions that can be affected by the very policy choice that SCC is meant to inform. For this reason and others, such as the choice of social discount rate, the 
estimates of the SCC range from near zero to hundreds of dollars per ton of carbon.
<br>
Instead of the often-complex process of economic valuation, MCDA typically relies on a set of alternative methods for establishing relative values or weights on 
different criteria, to be chosen by the decisionmakers. The identification of weights may be done by introspection, deliberation, or negotiation-or some combination 
of the three-among stakeholders. Setting relative weights may also be done as part of an iterative process in which alternatives are evaluated, weights reassessed in 
light of the evaluation, and new criteria weights applied.
<br>
One example of how relative weights for different criteria are set in MCDA is through application of the analytical hierarchy process. In this process, decisionmakers 
are asked to determine a set of top-level criteria, and within each of these to determine the subcomponent criteria. They are then asked to rank the relative 
importance of criteria at each level of the hierarchy. For example, suppose a decisionmaker is evaluating policies aimed at controlling non-point-source pollution 
from agriculture with two overarching criteria of water quality and economic effects. If these criteria are assigned equal importance, then each receives a weight of 
0.5. At the next level of hierarchy, suppose that the water quality criteria include water clarity, dissolved oxygen content, and temperature, and that the economic 
criteria include farm income and jobs. If the decisionmaker believes that water clarity is twice as important as dissolved oxygen, and dissolved oxygen is twice as 
important as temperature, their weights at this level of hierarchy are 4/7, 2/7, and 1/7, respectively. Suppose that jobs are ranked as twice as important as farm 
income, then the weights would be 2/3 and 1/3. The overall weights in the analysis would then be 0.5 times these values: 2/7 for water clarity, 1/7 for dissolved 
oxygen content, 1/14 for water temperature, 1/3 for jobs, and 1/6 for farm income.
<br>
A potentially important difference between economic and MCDA approaches to valuation is in whose values are incorporated. In principle, valuation in benefit/cost 
assessments includes the value of everyone affected by management or policy choices, though in practice there may be questions about whether economic valuation 
methods accurately reflect societal values. In MCDA, it is typically a smaller subset of people that is involved in setting relative weights. For local-scale 
problems, MCDA methods could include all affected parties in a deliberative process, but as the scale of the problem grows, this will not be possible. For larger-
scale environmental problems, ranging up to global concerns such as climate change, there is the question of representation and whether those present adequately 
reflect the views of the wider public. In addition, relative weights in MCDA should not be treated as constant but should reflect changes in circumstances, something 
that is typically captured in economic valuation methods.
<br><br>
Weighty issues
<br>
Any environmental management or policy decision is likely to entail winners and losers. How should the distribution of benefits and costs across groups be treated in 
environmental management and policy decisions? Critics of benefit/cost analysis contend that reliance on economic valuation systematically disadvantages those with 
less money. Greater wealth means greater ability (and thus willingness) to pay, so benefit/cost analysis effectively gives more weight to those with more money 
('voting with dollars'). One way to answer this criticism is to give a higher weight to the values of those with less wealth. Economists have found considerable 
evidence of diminishing marginal utility of income, meaning that the value of an additional dollar to a poor person is greater than to a rich person. This fact can be 
used to justify 'equity weights' based on differences in wealth. For example, an equity weight argument would mean that otherwise equal damages from future climate 
change should be given greater weight in low-income countries than in high-income countries. In addition, if society is committed to protecting the interests of 
particular groups, it can constrain consideration of options to those that achieve specified distributional goals.
<br>
Since the effects of alternative environmental management and policy options will differ across generations, a fundamental challenge in valuing environmental 
management and policy decisions is how to aggregate benefits and costs that accrue to current and future generations (inter-generational distribution). For example, 
more aggressive climate change mitigation strategies impose costs on the current generation but generate benefits for future generations.Economists typically use 
discounting to aggregate benefits and costs over time. The standard economic rationale for discounting is that investments yield a positive expected real rate of 
return, so that having a dollar today is worth more than having a dollar in the future. Costs and benefits realized at different points in time are thus commensurable 
in present value terms after discounting.
<br>
The standard discounting approach works well for nearterm private investment decisions, but what about for longterm social decisions affecting the welfare of future 
generations? If one accepts the principle of equal moral standing of all generations, there would seem to be little ethical justification for discounting future 
welfare. Frank Ramsay, the father of economic approaches to discounting and growth theory, maintained that it was 'ethically indefensible' to treat the welfare of 
current and future generations differently. However, to the extent that future generations are expected to be better off than the current generation, discounting can 
be justified as an intergenerational application of equity weights. By the same principle, if environmental conditions worsen significantly and future generations are 
expected to be less well off than the present generation, this would imply a negative discount rate; that is, discounting of present benefits relative to future 
benefits. As recent debates on climate change policy aptly illustrate, there is little agreement among economists, or between economists and others, on discounting.
<br>
Uncertainty is a central issue in environmental management and policy. Uncertainty enters at various steps in the link between management and policy choices and 
eventual effects on the value of outcomes. There can be uncertainty about how changes in management or policy affect choices made by individuals and businesses 
(behavioral uncertainty), how changes in human actions affect the environment (scientific uncertainty), and how consequent changes in the environment will affect 
human well-being (value uncertainty). Recent work on the value of ecosystems services illustrates each of these uncertainties. For example, the Conservation Reserve 
Program, which pays landowners for taking land out of production and restores perennial vegetation, can shift patterns of land use and, in turn, result in changes in 
carbon sequestration, water quality, and habitat provision. Program participation and the provision of services depend on the choices of individual landowners, which 
are uncertain. There are key gaps in the science linking land use to service provision, such as how changes in land use will affect changes in carbon storage in soil 
or populations of particular species, making provision uncertain even when behavioral uncertainty is ignored. There are also key gaps in information pertaining to the 
link between services and benefits, making value uncertain even if provision is known. The value of water quality improvement, for example, depends as much on who 
uses the water and for what purpose as on the water quality itself.
<br>
Economic approaches typically use an expected utility framework to deal with uncertainty, where the value of each potential outcome is weighted by its probability of 
occurrence. This approach summarizes expected social net benefits across dimensions, as discussed above, but also across all possible outcomes that could occur given 
a management or policy choice. Using the expected utility framework, however, requires information about probabilities as well as values under all potential outcomes. 
For environmental issues involving complex system dynamics, such as climate change or the provision of ecosystem services, the list of possible outcomes in the future 
may be unknown, much less how to specify probabilities or likely values for each of these outcomes. Beyond the challenge of scientific uncertainty, there may also be 
uncertainty about the preferences of future generation and how they will value various outcomes. Inability to objectively quantify probabilities or values requires 
modifying expected utility, such as by using subjective judgments to establish probabilities or values, or setting bounds on decisions thought to pose unacceptable 
risks (for example, safe minimum standards). A particular challenge to making decisions under uncertainty arises from consideration of catastrophic outcomes. It is 
difficult to set probabilities on such events because they are rare, but small changes in assumptions about these probabilities can lead to large changes in policy 
advice.
<br>
People make mistakes, often in systematic and predictable ways. They tend to be overly optimistic, biased toward the present, and averse to losses. They have trouble 
thinking through complex problems, especially those with uncertainty. Given these facts, some analysts question the validity of using valuation studies that rely on 
observed choices, survey responses, or even deliberative processes among affected parties as an important input for setting environmental policy. The alternative, 
however, would be to delegate judgments about the relative value of outcomes to political leaders or scientific experts. Elected leaders, at least in theory, should 
reflect public values. Environmental scientists, however, have no special claim to understanding public values. In either case, there is no guarantee that top-down 
decisions will reflect the underlying values of the public at large any better than an imperfect reflection of values gathered through valuation exercises.
<br>
In principle, economic valuation methods can estimate value for all environmental attributes, either through inferences from observable behavior or responses in 
stated preference surveys. In practice, however, it is generally not possible to get a complete economic assessment of all environmental values. Some values connected 
with the environment are notoriously difficult to assess in monetary terms. For example, what is the monetary value of conserving species with important spiritual or 
cultural value? Some critics contend that individuals are cognitively incapable of evaluating tradeoffs between utilitarian goods (such as commodities and ecosystem 
services) and moral goods (such as the existence of a species). There are sharp disagreements between psychologists and economists-and among economists themselves-on 
this point. Even when it is possible in principle to estimate monetary values, there may be insufficient data to do so. Nevertheless, economic methods can provide 
evidence about the value of many important environmental attributes.
<br><br>
The value of valuation
<br>
Though difficult, collecting information about the relative values of alternative potential outcomes, in all of their multiple dimensions, is vital to good 
environmental management and policy decisionmaking. Setting environmental policy is not simply a matter of applying the best science, as important as that is. 
Environmental management and policy typically involve making decisions about tradeoffs among multiple objectives about which society cares. Making decisions about 
such tradeoffs involves making value judgments. If these judgments are to improve human wellbeing, they should reflect the underlying values of individuals affected 
by the policy.
<br>
Economic valuation methods applied in the context of environmental management and policy seek to inform decisionmaking by collecting information about the value of 
alternatives to affected individuals and then aggregating these values to determine an estimate of social net benefits. In simple benefit/cost analysis, the 
management or policy option with the highest social net benefits should then be the preferred option. The great advantage of the simple benefit/cost approach is that 
it incorporates economic valuation methods to represent values of the affected public, summarizes this information into a single ranking, and uses this ranking to 
help guide policy. Valuation information can also be combined with other decisions rules, such as those that minimize the risk of bad outcomes occurring.
<br>
Rather than trying to summarize everything in a single number, as in simple benefit/cost analysis, it may be better to disaggregate results and report a wider set of 
results instead. Reporting a single number can hide important implicit value judgments. Though less tidy, reporting a set of results has the advantage of letting 
decisionmakers see important distributional consequences by reporting benefits and costs to different groups (such as income classes, geographic regions, and 
generations), as well as a range of possible outcomes under important sources of uncertainty. Additionally, results can be shown for different assumptions about 
important parameter values over which there may be disagreement (for example, the discount rate). Doing so makes clear the effect of different modeling and value 
judgments on the ranking of alternatives and lets decisionmakers better understand whether rankings are robust to changes in assumptions. For example, in reviewing 
efforts by economists to measure 'inclusive wealth' intended to value all natural, human, manufactured, and social capital in order to provide a summary measure of 
sustainability, Joseph Stiglitz and Amartya Sen, two Nobel laureate economists, and colleagues concluded that such attempts overreach. Instead, they recommended that 
a number of measures be used, including biophysical measures in which the data or understanding are insufficient to provide trustworthy estimates of monetary value.
<br>
Regardless of whether a single number or set of results is reported for each management or policy option, analysts working in support of environmental decisionmaking 
have a duty to make the analysis transparent and the result clear. Why decisions are made can be explained and defended. 'Black box' models that only experts 
understand are rarely trusted by nonexperts and often fail to build support for decisions or trust in the process of decisionmaking.
<br>
Because there is no such thing as a perfect assessment of environmental effects or associated values, decisionmakers and others should view the results of 
benefit/cost analysis or MCDA as input into the decisionmaking process, rather than uncritically accepting the results and implementing the highest-ranked 
alternative. But done well, assessments that incorporate valuation information can inform and improve environmental decisionmaking.an be explained and defended.

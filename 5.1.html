Examples of Non Renewable Resources
<br><br>
Non-renewable resources are resources for which there is a limited supply. The supply comes from the Earth itself and, as it typically takes millions of years to develop, is finite. 
<br><br>
Categories of Non-Renewable Resources
<br>
Non-renewable resources can generally be separated into two main categories; fossil fuels and nuclear fuels.
<br><br>
Fossil Fuels
<br>
Fossil fuels are derived from organic matter which has been trapped between layers of sediments within the Earth for millions of years.
<br>
The organic matter, typically plants, have decomposed and compressed over time, leaving what are known as fossil fuel deposits. 
<br>
These deposits, and the materials produced from them, tend to be highly combustible, making them an ideal energy source. 
<br>
They are difficult to obtain as they are typically retrieved through drilling or mining, but fossil fuels are worth the effort for the sheer amount of energy they produce.
<br><br>
Crude Oil/Petroleum
<br>
Crude oil is a non-renewable resource that builds up in liquid form between the layers of the Earth's crust.
<br>
It is retrieved by drilling deep into the ground and pumping the liquid out. The liquid is then refined and used to create many different products.
<br>
Crude oil is a very versatile fuel and is used to produce things like plastics, artificial food flavorings, heating oil, petrol, diesel, jet fuel, and propane.
<br>
The top three oil-producing countries are Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the United States.
<br><br>
Gas
<br>
Natural gasses gather below the Earth's crust and, like crude oil, must be drilled for and pumped out.
<br>
Methane and ethane are the most common types of gasses obtained through this process.
<br>
These gasses are most commonly used in home heating as well as gas ovens and grills.
<br>
Russia, Iran, and Qatar are the countries with the largest recorded natural gas reserves.
<br><br>
Coal
<br>
Coal is the last of the major fossil fuels. Created by compressed organic matter, it is solid like rock and is obtained via mining.
<br>
Out of all countries, China produces the most coal by far.
<br>
According to the Statistical Review of World Energy, published in 2011 by BP, they produced an astounding 48.3% (3,240 million tons) of the world's coal in 2010, followed by the United States who produced a mere 14.8%.
<br>
Coal is most typically used in home heating and the running of power plants. 
<br><br>
Nuclear Fuels
<br>
The other form of non-renewable resource used to produce energy, nuclear fuels, is primarily obtained through the mining and refining of uranium ore.
<br>
Uranium is a naturally occurring element found within the Earth's core. 
<br>
Most uranium deposits occur in small quantities which miners gather together, refine, and purify. 
<br>
Once gathered, the uranium is brought together and compounded into rods. 
<br>
The rods are then submersed into tanks of water. 
<br>
When it reaches critical mass, uranium begins to break down and release energy which heats the water it is immersed in. This is known as "fission."
<br>
The heated water then creates pressure and it is this pressure which drives the turbines that generate the electricity we use everyday.
<br><br>
Mining impacts
<br>
Coal mining, the first step in the dirty lifecycle of coal, causes deforestation and releases toxic amounts of minerals and heavy metals into the soil and water. Coal mining's effects persist for years after coal is removed.
<br>
Destruction and poison linger
<br>
Bad mining practices can ignite coal fires, which can burn for decades, release fly ash and smoke laden with greenhouse gasses and toxic chemicals. Furthermore mining releases coal mine methane, a greenhouse gas 20 times more powerful than carbon dioxide. Coal dust inhalation causes black lung disease among miners and those who live nearby, and mine accidents kill thousands every year. Coal mining displaces whole communities, forced off their land by expanding mines, coal fires, subsidence and contaminated water supplies.
<br>
There are two widely used ways of mining: strip mining and underground mining.
<br><br>
Strip mining
<br>
Strip mining (also known as open cast, mountaintop or surface mining) involves scraping away earth and rocks to get to coal buried near the surface. In many cases, mountains are literally blasted apart to reach thin coal seams within, leaving permanent scars on the landscape as a result.
<br>
Strip mining accounts for about 40 percent of the world's coal mines but in some countries, such as Australia, open cast mines make up 80 percent of mines. Even though it's highly destructive, industry often prefers strip mining as it requires less labour and yields more coal than underground mining.
<br><br>
Impacts of strip mining:
<br>
Strip mining destroys landscapes, forests and wildlife habitats at the site of the mine when trees, plants, and topsoil are cleared from the mining area. This in turn leads to soil erosion and destruction of agricultural land.
<br>
When rain washes the loosened top soil into streams, sediments pollute waterways. This can hurt fish and smother plant life downstream, and cause disfiguration of river channels and streams, which leads to flooding.
<br>
There is an increased risk of chemical contamination of ground water when minerals in upturned earth seep into the water table, and watersheds are destroyed when disfigured land loses the water it once held.
<br>
Strip mining causes dust and noise pollution when top soil is disrupted with heavy machinery and coal dust is created in mines.
<br>
The result of all this is barren land that stays contaminated long after a coal mine shuts down.
<br>
Although many countries require reclamation plans for coal mining sites, undoing all the environmental damages to water supplies, destroyed habitats, and poor air quality is a long and problematic task. This land disturbance is on a vast scale. In the US, between 1930 and 2000, coal mining altered about 2.4 million hectares [5.9 million acres] of natural landscape, most of it originally forest. Attempts to re-seed land destroyed by coal mining is difficult because the mining process has so thoroughly damaged the soil. For example, in Montana, replanting projects had a success rate of only 20-30 percent, while in some places in Colorado only 10 percent of oak aspen seedlings that were planted survived.
<br>
In China, coal mining has degraded the quality of land of an estimated 3.2 million hectares, according to a 2004 estimate. The overall restoration rate (the ratio of reclaimed land area to the total degraded land area) of mine wasteland was only about 10-12 percent.
<br><br>
Underground mining
<br>
The majority of the world's coal is obtained through underground mines.  While underground mining, which allows coal companies to extract deeper deposits of coal, is viewed as less destructive than strip mining, it still causes widespread damage to the environment. In room-and-pillar mines, columns of coal are left to support the ground above during the initial mining process, then they are often taken out and the mine is left to collapse, which is known as subsidence. In longwall mines, mechanical shearers strip the coal from the mines. Support structures that enable the shearers' access to the mine are eventually removed, and the mine collapses.
<br><br>
Impacts of underground mining
<br>
Underground mining causes huge amounts of waste earth and rock to be brought to the surface - waste that often becomes toxic when it comes into contact with air and water.
<br>
It causes subsidence as mines collapse and the land above it starts to sink. This causes serious damage to buildings.
<br>
It lowers the water table, changing the flow of groundwater and streams. In Germany for example, over 500 million cubic metres of water are pumped out of the ground every year. Only a small percentage of this is used by industry or local towns - the rest is wasted. What's worse is that removing so much water creates a kind of funnel that drains water from an area much larger than the immediate coal-mining environment.
<br>
Coal mining also produces greenhouse gas emissions.
<br><br>
Coal mine methane
<br>
Coal mine methane, less prevalent in the atmosphere than CO2, but 20 times as powerful as a greenhouse gas, forms during the geological formation of coal, and is released during the coal mining process. Most coal mine methane  come from underground mines. While this methane is often captured and used as town fuel, industrial fuel, chemical feedstock and vehicle fuel, it's very rare that it all gets used. Methane is also used in power generation projects. However, despite big investment in research, only about 50 such projects exist worldwide.
<br>
In China, which mines more than 95 percent of its coal underground, about 300 of the state-owned mines are classified as methane-outburst prone.
<br>
Worldwide emissions are expected to increase by 20 percent in the next 12 years.
<br><br>
Coal fires
<br>
Coal fires - burning or smouldering coal seams, coal storage piles or coal waste piles - are a significant environmental problem in many countries, including China, Russia, the US, Indonesia, Australia and South Africa. Underground coal fires can burn for centuries, filling the atmosphere with smoke laden with carbon-monoxide (CO), carbon-dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrous oxides (NOx) and other greenhouse or toxic gases - as well as fly ash from vents and fissures.
<br>
Other effects of coal fires include rising surface temperatures and contamination of groundwater, soil and air.
<br>
Although coal fires can be caused by thunderstorm lightning, and forest or peat fires, they are often caused by mining accidents and improper mining techniques. In Indonesia, the same fires that are used to clear large tracts of rainforest have ignited over 300 coal fires since the 1980s.
<br>
China has the world's most coal fires, while India accounts for the world's greatest concentration. In China, between 15 and 20 million tons of coal burn uncontrollably each year, accounting for between 0.1 percent and 1 percent of the world's human-induced CO2 emissions, (Although coal fires are significant, emissions from power plants are far higher.)
<br><br>
Acid mine drainage
<br>
Acid mine drainage is created when water mixes with coal and other rocks unearthed during mining, taking on toxic levels of minerals and heavy metals. This toxic water leaks out of abandoned mines to contaminate groundwater, streams, soil, plants, animals and humans. As a result an orange colour can blanket the river, estuary or sea bed killing plants and making surface water unusable as drinking water. 
<br>
Sources of acid mine drainage can remain active for decades or centuries after a mine closes.
<br><br>
Common health threats posed by coal mining:
<br>
Pneumoconiosis, aka black lung disease or CWP, is caused when miners breathe in coal dust and carbon, which harden the lungs. Estimates show that 1,200 people in the US still die from black lung disease annually. The situation in developing countries is even worse.
<br>
Cardiopulmonary disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, lung disease, and kidney disease have been found in higher-than-normal rates among residents who live near coal mines, according to a 2001 US study.
<br>
Toxic levels of arsenic, fluorine, mercury, and selenium are emitted by coal fires, entering the air and the food chain of those living nearby.
<br>
Mine collapses and accidents kill thousands of workers around the world every year. Chinese coal mine accidents killed 4,700 people in 2006.
<br>
Nuclear fuels are key to maintaining the Earth's environment since they are the cleanest of all non-renewable resources.
<br><br>
Nuclear Fission
<br>
Nuclear fission is a form of alternative energy, that can be utilized in place of fossil fuels that are most commonly used. Nuclear power plants are the way that this energy is generated and harnessed, but they have come under much criticism. Problems with safety is the main concern. Highly radioactive and dangerous substances, such as uranium, is split, when this happens, the atoms speed up and generate quite a bit of heat, which is then converted to energy. In order to better understand the consequences as well as the benefits that come with nuclear fission energy we must look at the facts from both sides of the argument.
<br><br>
The Advantages of Nuclear Fission<br>
1. Significantly Less Green House Gases<br>
The use of fossil fuels for energy has been devastating to our environment, and the planet as a whole. They are known to contribute to the problem of global warming. Nuclear fission energy, releases a highly reduced amount of these gases into the air, resulting in a slowed rate of global warming and pollution.
<br>
2. Able To Meet High Needs<br>
The power that is generated through nuclear power plants is immense. They are able to meet the needs of large, and industrial cities as well as suburban towns. The energy is also quick to create, meaning that they are able to make a large amount of some form of emergency required it.
<br>
3. Somewhat Low Operating Costs<br>
While the initial building costs may be very high, the costs to operate a nuclear power plant are minimal. The only costs that are truly incurred are through paying people to run the plants, as well as obtaining the substances needed to create the energy.
<br>
4. Room For Improvement<br>
One of the biggest issue with nuclear fission energy is the high production of nuclear waste, which is toxic and harmful to all living things, as well as water and air supplies. By improving water recycling and the reprocessing procedures of these plants, this issue can be nearly eliminated in the near future.
<br>
5. The Technology Is Known<br>
Nuclear technology has been around for quite sometime, and is very well understood. This makes it a great option because the process has been nearly perfected, and improvements are being researched and studied at a much faster rate than other types of alternative energy.
<br><br>
The Disadvantages of Nuclear Fission<br>
1. Very Volatile<br>
A big risk is involved in operating a nuclear power plant. The energy that is generated can easily be harnessed to make devastating weapons, such as the nuclear bomb. The plants themselves also pose a great risk, if accidents occur, the entire plant could explode, injuring and possibly even killing many people.
<br>
2. Dangers For Workers<br>
Nuclear fission produces radiation, which is deadly for humans and animals if absorbed in large doses. The people that work in nuclear power plants are at great risk of developing serious health conditions, and even from suffering radiation poisoning.
<br>
3. Initial Costs Are Staggering<br>
The amount of money that it takes to build a nuclear fission power plant is insane. This is because all of the complex technologies that are needed and the extreme safety measures that must be built into the plant to ensure the surrounding areas are safe.
<br>
4. Risks For Contamination
If the proper procedures are not taken to ensure that the nuclear waste is disposed of properly, than many people could be put at great risk. There have been times where water supplies are contaminated, and widespread illness has occurred.
<br>
5. Big Targets On Their Backs<br>
Terrorists want to target places that would cause the most widespread damage. Nuclear fission power plants are possibly the biggest targets for these attacks. Even a small bomb or explosion could cause major problems with a nuclear power plant, and even cause the entire thing to explode.
